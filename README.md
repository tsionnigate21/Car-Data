## Introduction
For this project, we sat at the radar detector and recorded the date, time, speed, orange light, license plate by state, weather, and temperature of the different cars passing through. 

## Dictionary
- Radar detector located near 30th St and 24th Avenue in Rock Island IL
- Collected at least 50 cars per person(totaling more than 200)

## Installation of Required Packages:
-Made sure we had the following R packages installed: ggplot2, shiny, DT, readxl.

## Data Preparation:
-Made sure the location of our speed data in an Excel file named "MergedCarData.xlsx".
-The Excel file contained a column named "Speed".

##Running the Shiny App:
-We set our working directory to the location where the "MergedCarData.xlsx" file is located.
-Run the provided R code in RStudio or any other R environment.

## Data Organization
1. We started by merging our data into one Excel file.
2. 
## Shiny Results with Chart
-Shiny displayed the following statistics about the speed data:
  Minimum speed
  Maximum speed
  Median speed
  Mean speed
-Additionally, it generated a histogram visualizing the distribution of speeds.



## Conclusion 

- Insert charts here :)
- Remember we need to add a link somewhere
- Possibly also a link to our essay
